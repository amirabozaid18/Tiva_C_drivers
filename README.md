All these files are written by me except "tm4c123gh6pm.h" which defines all registers. Without including it, you will have to open datasheet and deal with base and offset addresses for all registers so for using drivers directly without any edition, please do not exclude it from any header file

You do not have to open header files to understand how any function works and when to use it, you just need to read the description file for each module very carefuuly since I will explain each function clearly and the enumerations I have created since you will use some of them when you call some of my function in your main
