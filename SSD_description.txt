This file describes all functions related to SSD(seven segments display).


At first, you must know the enumerations used with SSD:

1)"SSD_type" which has only 2 values: COMMON_ANODE and COMMON_CATHODE to determine the type of the SSD.
2)"status" which has only 2 values: ENABLED and DISABLED to determine if the dot will ne used or not.



The functions used with SSD are:

1) void SSD_init(char data_port_name,char control_port_name, uint8_t control_pin, status dot_status, SSD_type  configuration);		

This function is used to initialize the SSD before using it, data pins are
ordered as A-B-C-D-E-F-G-DOT(if enabled) and map to pin0-pin6(if DOT is disabled) or pin0-pin7((if DOT is enabled)) respectively.

Example 1: SSD_init('A','B',4,ENABLED,COMMON_ANODE) will define all pins of portA from PA0 to PA7 as data pins
and PB4 as the control pin(used to enable/disable SSD).

Example 2: SSD_init('D','F',2,DISABLED,COMMON_CATHODE) will define pins PB0 to PB6 as data pins
and PF2 as the control pin(used to enable/disable SSD). 

Example 3: SSD_init('F','A',2,ENABLED,COMMON_ANODE) is useless since the data_port_name can not be portE or portF because their pins
number is less than 7.










2) void SSD_show(char myinput);

This function is used to display one character on SSD.

Example 1: SSD_show('2') will display 2 on SSD.

Example 2: SSD_show('F') will display F on SSD.






3) void turn_SSD_on(char control_port_name, uint8_t control_pin);

This function is used to make SSD work whether for first time or resume working after it was disabled.

Example 1: turn_SSD_on(E,'3') will make the SSD whose control pin is PE3 start/resume working.

Example 2: turn_SSD_on(C,'6') will make the SSD whose control pin is PC6 start/resume working.









4) void turn_SSD_off(char control_port_name, uint8_t control_pin);

This function is used to make LCD stop working.

Example 1: turn_SSD_off('A',4) will make the SSD whose control pin is PA4 stop working.

Example 2: turn_SSD_off('F',0) will make the SSD whose control pin is PF0 stop working.



tip: for using multiple SSDs who share the same data pins to save MCU pins to
display anything that consist of more than one digit do the following:

1- turn first SSD on 
2- display first digit on it
3- wait few microseconds
4- turn it off

5- turn second SSD on 
6- display second digit on it
7- wait few microseconds
8- turn it off

9- turn third SSD on 
10- display third digit on it
11- wait few microseconds
12- turn it off

n- turn last SSD on
n+1- display last digit on it
n+2- wait few microseconds
n+3- turn it off


and the repeat the whole process with a high frequency.
