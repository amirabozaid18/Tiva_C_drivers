This file describes the functions used with LCD(liquid crystal display) 2*16.


At first, you must know the only enumeration used with LCD:
"size" which has only 2 values: FOUR_BITS and EIGHT_BITS to determine the number of pins used to send data to LCD.




The functions used with LCD:

1) void LCD_init(uint8_t lines_number, char data_port_name, char control_port_name, uint8_t rs_pin,
uint8_t rw_pin, uint8_t e_pin, size working_mode);
 
This function is used to initialize the LCD before using it.

Example 1: LCD_init(2,'A','B',3,5,0,EIGHT_BITS) will define all pins in portA from PA0 to PA7 as output
pins so MCU send data to LCD through them, PB3 as RS pin in LCD, PB5 as RW pin in LCD, PB0 as Enable pin
in LCD, and the sent data will be displayed on the 2 lines. 

Example 2: LCD_init(1,'D','F',0,2,4,EIGHT_BITS) will define all pins in portD from PD0 to PD7 as output
pins so MCU send data to LCD through them, PF0 as RS pin in LCD, PF2 as RW pin in LCD, PF4 as Enable pin
in LCD, and the sent data will be displayed on the first line. 

Example 3: LCD_init(1,'B','E',5,3,1,FOUR_BITS) will define only the upper pins in portB from PB4 to PB7 as output
pins so MCU send data to LCD through them, PE5 as RS pin in LCD, PE3 as RW pin in LCD, PE1 as Enable pin
in LCD, and the sent data will be displayed on the first line. 

Example 4: LCD_init(2,'E','F',0,2,4,EIGHT_BITS) is useless since PORTE pins are just from PE0 to PE5. 















2) void LCD_command(uint8_t command);

This function is used to send a command to LCD, you can find all commands in LCD datasheet.
I am not sure if all commands in all LCDs are the same, so the examples below are for the one that I used.

Example 1: LCD_command(0x06)  will make the Cursor shift right.

Example 2: LCD_command(0x0E)  will turn on both display and cursor.

Example 3: LCD_command(0x01)  will clear the LCD screen.












3) void LCD_char(uint8_t mychar);

This function is used to display one character, I prefer not using this function
since you can display whatever you want through next 2 functions.

Example 1: LCD_char('A') will display the character 'A' on LCD.

Example 2: LCD_char('f') will display the character 'f' on LCD.












4) void LCD_display_string(char* mystring);

This function is used to display a string of any numbers of characters on LCD.

Example 1: LCD_display_string("Welcome to LCD tutorial") will display the string(Welcome to LCD tutorial) on LCD.

Example 2: LCD_display_string("W") will display the character(W) on LCD.

Example 3: LCD_display_string("Kind regards, see you soon") will display the string(Kind regards, see you soon) on LCD.












5) void LCD_display_number(int64_t mynumber);

This function is used to display an integer number( positive, negative, or zero) whose size is up to 64 bits on LCD.

Example 1: LCD_display_number(0) will display 0 on LCD.

Example 2: LCD_display_number(-987654321) will display -987654321 on LCD.

Example 2: LCD_display_number(102030405060708090) will display 102030405060708090 on LCD.













6) void LCD_go_to_first_line(void);

This function is used to force the LCD go to the beginning of the first line.

Example: LCD_go_to_first_line() will make the LCD go to beginning of first line.














7) void LCD_go_to_second_line(void);

This function is used to force the LCD go to the beginning of the second line, it can be used only if
the lines number defined in LCD_init() is 2 lines not 1 line.

Example: LCD_go_to_second_line() will make the LCD go to beginning of second line.
















8) void LCD_clear_screen(void);

This function is used to clear the LCD screen.

Example: LCD_clear_screen() will clear the whole LCD screen.
